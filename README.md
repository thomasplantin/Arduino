# Arduino

/*Code for the Arduino of the Mailbox Transmitter Module of Papa's gift. 
 * This is the final version of the code for this project. It checks if there is mail in the mailbox, and if there is, it sends a signal to the module in the house to notify to user.
 * It also probes the level of the battery, and if it is low, it alerts the user by sending a signal to the module in the house.
 * This code has been configured in order to minimize the power consumption, such that the battery life can be optimized.
